This is my personal build of `dwmblocks`.

## Updates
- Added the blocks
- Trigger the block signal by adding $34$ to the signal number
- Bug fix: Modify `terhandler` to accept an int parameter `signum`

## References
- Mostly forked from torrinfail's [repo](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks).
