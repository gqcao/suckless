My personal adaptation of st-0.9.1

## Updates
- `alpha focus highlight`
- Enable `delkey` in the command line
- `externalpipe`: to parse urls
    - Scan, open and copy urls by `dmenu`
- Changed to the light blue color for comments
- Set font size to 20
- Parse links in editor
    - Follow urls by pressing `alt-l`
    - Copy urls in the same way with `alt-y`
    - Copy the output of commands with `alt-o`
